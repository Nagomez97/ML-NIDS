# FlowMeter
**CICFlowMeter** is a tool developed by the [Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity](https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter). It can extract statistical features from a *.pcap* file and write them into a *.csv* file in order to use it as a ML dataset.

The current version of this tool is a bit buggy, so Vision includes its own version, with a couple of fixes.
